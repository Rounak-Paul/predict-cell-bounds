        "Deep Learning has been very successful in solving many complex problems in the real world. However, solving most of these challenges requires data. Additionally, having data is not just enough. The data has to be cleansed, annotated, and organized. Moreover, data in many domains is not accessible due to privacy constraints (Especially in the medical domain). Hence it becomes pertinent to create models that can learn from a limited amount of data.\n",
